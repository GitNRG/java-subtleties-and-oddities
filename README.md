# Java Subtleties And Oddities

This project contains a bunch of java code examples that demonstrate interesting language aspects. The only requirement to each snippet is to be interesting and/or useful. Please note that this project contains a lot of terrible practices and I highly **do not** recommend you use them. Such things are intended to warn you of tricky pitfalls, understand java better or just make you smile (or cringe).

To use it simply clone project and start playing with code. Each class has main method, so you can easily run every example or even debug it.

I'm convinced that there are much-much more examples to add, so if you know any - you can share them with us here. In this case please follow these guidlines:
* Avoid duplicates - although some examples may have overlapping features the key point of each examples should be unique.
* Keep it structured - try to wrap your example with a method/class to isolate it from the rest of the code. Put it in the right package and class (or create one if needed)
* Keep it documented - explain your examples with at least one line of javadoc, use descriptive names and add Description anntotation.
* Keep in runnable - you should be able to run each example, modify and explore it if needed. To demostrate compilation error please use comments
